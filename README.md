## Short description
Totally rewritten frontend for vspipe.exe.
The goal is to replace VSEdit Job Server Watcher, with more functions not available in VSEdit JSW.
Though it's not stable yet, it provides:
 - drag&drop for one or more VPY files
 - JSON file for every saved preset
 - INI file for saved settings
 - a dedicated form for presets management 
 - saving on closing and reloading on opening of all jobs in queue, automatically
 - shutdown, stand-by and reboot commands after all jobs are done

## Usage
If you have already used VSEdit Job Server Watcher, usage is the same. Exception is made for placeholder {ss}, witch now will be replaced with full subsampling string (ex. yuv420p, instead of 420).
In case not, usage is:

 - create a new job by clicking on "New" button
 - drag&drop or choose one VPY file
 - create and/or choose a preset to use
 - click on "Done" button to add the job to queue
 - repeat the operation until all jobs are added
 - click on "Start" and wait

##Notes
 - This is not another job server watcher, it simply manage encode jobs via GUI the same way of VSEdit Job Server Watcher.
